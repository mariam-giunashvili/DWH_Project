# Data Integration and ETL Pipeline using PL/pgSQL

## Project Overview
This project was developed for EPAM Systems' Data Analytics Engineering program, during specialization stage and focuses on integrating data from two OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems. The project follows a structured ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process and employs Ralph Kimballâ€™s dimensional modeling methodology to construct a data warehouse. The implementation is done in PostgreSQL using PL/pgSQL, ensuring robust error handling, logging, and data management throughout the process.

## Key Features
- **Data Extraction & Loading In Staging Layer**:
  - Data is initially loaded into **PostgreSQL external tables**.
  - Then, it is moved into **source tables** for further processing.

- **Data Cleaning & Integration**:
  - Data from different business areas is cleaned and integrated to ensure consistency and correctness.
  
- **Schema Construction & Normalization**:
  - A **3rd Normal Form (3NF) schema** is built to store transactional data efficiently.
  - Data is then transformed and loaded into a **dimensional star schema** for optimized analytical processing.

- **ETL Process Implementation in PL/pgSQL**:
  - The entire ETL pipeline is implemented using **PL/pgSQL stored procedures**.
  - **Error handling and logging mechanisms** track all transformations and modifications applied to each table.

- **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs) Implementation**:
  - **SCD Type 1**: Overwrites old values with new ones for updates.
  - **SCD Type 2**: Maintains historical data by adding versioning to records.

## Technologies Used
- PostgreSQL
- PL/pgSQL (Procedural Language for PostgreSQL)
- Data Warehousing Concepts (Dimensional Modeling, Star Schema)
- ETL Methodologies
- Logging and Error Handling in PL/pgSQL

## Summary
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building a data warehousing solution by integrating multiple OLTP systems, following industry-standard methodologies, and implementing robust ETL processes with PL/pgSQL. The final system ensures **data integrity, historical tracking, and optimized querying for analytical insights**.
